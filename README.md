# HK-Rainfall-HMM

# Introduction

Hong Kong is a city located in a subtropical area. The position intensely affects the rainfall level in Hong Kong, especially in summer. The availability of rainfall data from Hong Kong Observatory allows the formation of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). 
The main objectives of the project are to make predictions on the hidden state of the rainfall data by utilizing decoding problems and to find out the optimal sequence by using Algorithms, and also to make predictions on probability by utilizing the Algorithm in the Hidden Markov Model. The project takes the rainfall data in Hong Kong from 1947 to 2021. 
The results of the prediction would show whether the Hidden Markov Model can be used to predict the probability of rainfall data availability.
